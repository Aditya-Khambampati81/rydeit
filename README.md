this is a taxi aggregator , we managed to do for OLA and Uber cab booking 
OLA  - Handles ride tracking and entire lifecycle 
UBER - Apparently uber did not allow us to use their API for aggregation, so we have a configuration to turn off and on,
the default one takes to uber app
Flipkart - It also uses one of the affiliate API for flipkart

Next Steps :
*************

We would like to re-write most of it with more modern code
1. Newer version of Retrofit 
2. Using realm 
3. Switching to MVVM 
4. Using RX Android and Jakewhartons Rxbindings 

Contributions from all are welcome...  Also we plan to add lyft and other taxi vendors here.
